                  for this study. The researcher has presented several
                  recommendations to increase the efficiency and user
                  friendliness of the application. These recommendations are not
                  yet practically implemented on the online system. Therefore,
                  we hope to implement these suggestions with more additional
                  features and modern technologies to provide friendly
                  experience to the users.

                  <br />

                  The following research article is about such an implemented
                  idea that will broaden and expand this idea even more. Through
                  their investigation approach, they sought to fulfill a
                  blockchain-based digital forensic control model managing
                  Hyperledger Fabric and Docker to ensure the reliability of
                  digital forensic medicine. Hereby using the hyper ledger
                  concept their sole intention is to use the digital certificate
                  and public-key cryptography technology and thereby securing
                  identity, access permission, and role of participating users
                  in the network. Through this, the users who have the access to
                  the data and network can actively participate in the
                  blockchain and provide privacy and confidentiality between the
                  participants. Another research carried under the blockchain
                  concept can be also discussed in relevance to this, under
                  their solution they tried to implement an IOT base system that
                  will offer criminal investigation with correct authenticity,
                  immutability, traceability, and a distributed trust between
                  the entities and users. In Blockchains, the details of
                  evidence recognition, preservation, examination, and
                  presentation will be recorded.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  The actual gap between the aforementioned researches and the
                  component which is going to be implemented in relevance to my
                  component is that using the blockchain concept in order to
                  store the cryptographic keys a two-factor authentication
                  method is implemented and thereby the cryptographic keys will
                  not be required to be stored in main servers and thereby it
                  will lead to many beneficiary results like, this can avoid
                  single point of failures and can ensure the safety and data
                  integrity.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  The concept, which is proposed by my component, is designed
                  with many more functionalities than other research which are
                  currently prevailing and it also contains several innovative
                  novel ideas that will bridge the gap for several existing
                  problems in the Sri Lankan criminal and forensic investigation
                  sector. So undoubtedly it will be a supporting backbone for
                  many of the unsolved problems.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  There is no existing crime data analysis and prediction system
                  in Sri Lanka. Most of the other countries have made their own
                  crime and law enforcement related data analysis systems. Some
                  of these systems are also develop for prediction purposes.
                  Purpose of inventing these crime data analysis tools is to
                  support police and other law enforcement authorities. That
                  premade software is very difficult to use and need lot of
                  training. As low technical country these complex software’s
                  aren’t suitable to use in Sri Lanka. Making a minimalistic and
                  minimal training needed tool would give lot of support police
                  authorities in Sri Lanka. If we consider India Yadev’s Crime
                  Prediction system, main disadvantage of it is not using
                  software metrics for the accuracy checking of their software .

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  Elderly monitoring system they created an action dataset in
                  which the most common abnormal behavior is falling down. They
                  also used data augmentation to generate a variety of training
                  samples and avoid severe over-fitting. They only used the ECO
                  model, which included a deep convolutional neural network
                  (CNN) and was able to classify a behavior accurately at the
                  outset. The temporal neighborhood of the video frame is
                  primarily composed of redundant data, with little useful
                  information for increasing the confidence score about the
                  current behavior. However, they only compared each frame
                  individually, which resulted in a low level of accuracy and a
                  longer process in that model. This paper proposed using
                  computer vision (OpenCV) to gather all of the key points in
                  the human body using the mediapipe holistic model, and the
                  main difference was that it was not just a single frame, but a
                  large number of frames saved as NumPy arrays. This number of
                  sequence arrays was compared with an LSTM neural network to
                  improve the accuracy of the crime action detection model.

                After engaging in continuous researching for it was found out
                that there is still a significant scope for development in the
                in the “Block chain” concept that will allow users to securely
                store the cryptographic keys rather than storing them in the
                main server which will probably lead to a single point of
                failures, and which will also have possible threats due to
                unauthorized access by outsiders. Therefore, as it was found out
                that there is still some untouched and unexplored insights
                regarding this concept it’s better to use a new , efficient yet
                a novel concept that would sum up the afore mentioned loophole.
                The concept of “two factor authentications” would be a classic
                solution that will ultimately ease up many of the security wise,
                technical wise as well as practical wise implementational
                hardships.

                <br />
                <br />

                Another unaddressed, yet an existing problem within the criminal
                and forensic field is that there is no specific way or a
                specific methodology that will modify the most confidential data
                of clients, criminals etc. These types of sensitive data should
                be stored under a high security without letting them to be
                disclosed to a third party, and without a single point of data
                leakage. The party requesting the information must also be made
                clear that the disclosure is made solely for the benefit of the
                proceedings at issue and that the material should not be
                disclosed to any other person. An undertaking of confidentiality
                cannot always be easily provided by a third party. In civil
                cases, however, there is an implicit assurance by the party to
                whom the papers are served that they will not be used for
                collateral or subsequent purposes. So always the data should be
                secured and if someone tends or urge to modify some of the
                existing data , there should be a particular ,transparent
                process which will modify the existing data without altering the
                existing data. In addition to that there should be a particular
                way that will sequentially modify the existing data and keep
                track of modified data and documents as history in the records.
                So, this is yet another un-answered area in the criminal
                investigation and forensic field. Moreover, another unique theme
                that we found that was not brought into discussion by any of the
                authorities was a probable way to create the chain codes and web
                application interfaces for CRD organization. This is also yet to
                be answered through my research component.

                <br />
                <br />

                One of the most significant differences is that blockchains are
                not visible to the public, yet anyone can keep a backup of a
                blockchain on your device. The blocks of a blockchain are
                created using encryption, computers, and electricity. The most
                significant elements of blockchains are that they cannot be
                altered, are not governed by any single person, and the
                transactions can be interpreted by anyone. These characteristics
                are why people think that in a wide variety of applications, the
                technology has the ability to be used. But the usage of
                cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data is a tricky concept .
                Cryptographic keys are specifically used for data encryption so
                that the personal and sensitive data is not disclosed to a third
                party during the communication process. So when researching
                under the afore mentioned concept and ideology there were
                several research ideas and practically implemented research
                projects that used the “cryptographic concept in the block chain
                technology” so that it will securely store the certain details
                without being disclosed to a third party. The following research
                article is about such an implemented idea that will broaden and
                expand this idea even more. Through their academic vision, they
                sought to create a blockchain-based digital management approach
                with Hyperledger fabric and Docker to ensure the reliability of
                digital forensic medicine. Only authorized actors in a
                distributed environment with no centralized authority would be
                able to access the network to exchange and handle potential
                criminal material under the proposed electronic evidence
                management architecture. As a result, compared to the current
                client/server approach, it may be reasonably safe from harmful
                internal attackers.” Here the proposed solution is using a hyper
                ledger fabric to achieve the goal of the study. Hyperledger is
                an open-source platform for developing blockchain network
                infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer
                transactions. The main purpose of the hyper ledger concept is to
                use digital certificate and public key cryptography technology
                to secure the identity, access privilege, and activity of
                network participants Users who have access to the data as well
                as networks can then actively engage in the blockchain, ensuring
                privacy and secrecy for all participants. So, it’s obvious that
                under the discussed research solution that they are trying to
                implement a system that would use hyper ledger concept to block
                chains and there by ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

                <br />
                <br />

                Another research carried under the blockchain concept can be
                also discussed in relevance to this, they attempted to implement
                an IOT-based system that would provide criminal investigation
                with accurate authenticity, immutability, and distributed trust
                between entities and users as part of their solution. The
                identification, archiving, processing, and presentation of
                evidence shall be documented in blocks.

                <br />
                <br />

                The actual gap between the afore mentioned researches and the
                component which is going to be implemented in relevance to my
                component is that, using the block chain concept in order to
                store the cryptographic keys a two factor authentication method
                is implemented and thereby the cryptographic keys will not
                require to be stored in main servers and thereby it will lead to
                many beneficiary results like, this can avoid single point of
                failures and can ensure the safety and data integrity.

                <br />
                <br />

                Under the above component, it is planned to conduct another two
                important sub functions, namely creating a way to modify
                confidential data without altering the existing data and keeping
                a history of the modified data and the documents. Therefore,
                only the existing records will be updated, and it is guaranteed
                that the data history will be altered, and all the modifications
                will be recorded where necessary.

                <br />
                <br />

                In Sri Lanka, there is no prior research has been done in
                improving current client –sever architecture-based policing
                systems and replacing manual document processing systems.

                <br />
                <br />

                AI techniques such as ML and Data Science reached the world in
                crime prediction, the contribution of those technologies in Sri
                Lanka is still considerably less. For example, if other
                countries develop high technology involved crime prediction
                systems, unfortunately, the Sri Lankan government is still not
                interested in these technologies . A significant reason is an
                investment required in implementation and the lack of computer
                literacy in the government workforce. Compared to international
                research on this topic, this system provides a solution for
                every significant barrier in a fitting way to Sri Lanka. This
                system will introduce unique features fitting to the Sri Lankan
                environment by integrating our platform. My area of research
                contained a way to address significant barriers in implementing
                a whole new technological system in an environment like Sri
                Lanka.

                The existing Police clearance certificate issuing process
                usually takes more than 14 days to receive and some applicants
                didn’t get it within the expected time. This certificate is
                issued as a physical document delivered by the postal service
                which can be lost during the processing and delivering period
                and also takes extra time to receive. Furthermore, This process
                has also a risk of sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized
                personals within the delivery period.
                <br />
                <br />
                If an applicant abroad wants to get this certificate, he or she
                needs to wait until the document arrives at the high-commission,
                embassy, or consulate office previously mentioned in the
                requesting form. Also, these authorities won't take any
                responsibility for this document that comes in the post and they
                cannot assure a specific time for this document to receive.
                <br />
                <br />
                Besides, This police clearance certificate has no mechanism to
                verify the genuineness of it to third parties. These documents
                can be forged and presented, so relevant authorities have no
                procedure or capability to verify the document is issued by the
                Sri Lanka Police Department. There is a way to verify this
                document, which is by physically carry the document to the
                Police clearance certificate division and then, request to
                verify the document, and those who abroad have to go through
                various government agencies to verify this document which takes
                a significant amount of time and money. So existing clearance
                certificate process has a lack of efficiency, authenticity, and
                confidentiality that needs to be addressed using modern
                technologies.
                <br />
                <br />
                Currently, in conventional REST architecture, criminal
                documents, police investigation reports, and evidence reports
                are processed, rendering it susceptible to both insider and
                outsider attacks such as data tampering. Since these procedures
                and processes are not well protected and there is no way to
                verify honesty, openness, and accountability, fraud and
                corruption can occur. The transfer of confidential files and
                reports between police stations is a very slow process that
                loses resources, time and lacks coordination between different
                stakeholders. As a sample, if an individual makes a new
                complaint and it takes a few days to obtain it after requesting
                a copy. There is no proper mechanism that will sum up the
                aforementioned problems and through the entire research we are
                going to find a practical, yet the appropriate solution to the
                above-mentioned contemporary problem.
                <br />
                <br />
                Solving a criminal problem is a complex process that requires
                human intelligence and expertise, as well as methods which can
                help with crime prevention and detection challenges.
                Furthermore, the predicted future crime trends or patterns takes
                into account changes in criminal activity through one year to
                the next and utilizes predictive system to determine such future
                changes.
                <br />
                <br />
                According to police statistics, the number of crimes is rising
                quickly. People are being hurt every day. If this growing trend
                continues, the situation will be terrible for Sri Lanka. Small
                youngsters are influencing these crimes day by day. Parents do
                not have a good understanding of the setting in which their
                children are hanging with. Most of the time, considering young
                people, children, and elderly people are damaged primarily via
                crimes. Criminals also strive constantly to hurt vulnerable
                individuals. Because of this reason, young people must care more
                for their tiny children and their older parents. To accomplish
                this young people must have a firm understanding of their
                surroundings.

                Implement a way to issue a police clearance certificate as a
                digital document replacing the current physical document. So
                clearance certificate department will be able to send this
                document to the applicants and also to the overseas authorities
                via email, without sending it as a physical document which takes
                more time and money. Still, most of the authorities and
                companies accept official documents as physical documents, hence
                applicants can offer this document as an official document by
                printing this is document using recommended way. And also
                implement a way to check the authenticity and integrity of this
                document to any public entity without visiting the police
                clearance certificate division in Colombo. So it will be very
                helpful to both locals and overseas authorities.

                <br />
                <br />
                Implement a blockchain network that can replace the existing
                police information systems and manual document processing
                systems. Because the data in the police department cannot be
                hosted on public blockchain networks, this network should be a
                private, permissioned blockchain which only accessible by
                authorized personals and officers. Furthermore, this blockchain
                network should be scalable, so any number of police divisions
                and sections can connect to this network without affecting the
                whole network. And also the fault tolerance, which provides the
                capability to continue operations and transactions properly in
                an event of a failure. This blockchain network also should be
                able to provide key security components suchas integrity,
                transparency, and accountability which do not exist in
                traditional police systems used in the police department.

                <br />
                <br />
                Implement two factor authentication mechanisms to prevent
                unauthorized access to the system and create a way to securely
                store cryptographic keys for the blockchain users without
                storing them in the main servers preventing single point of
                failure. The concept of “two factor authentications” would be a
                classic solution that will ultimately ease up many of the
                security wise, technical wise as well as practical wise
                implementational hardships.
                <br />
                <br />
                Create a way to modify confidential data without altering the
                existing data and keep a history of the modified data. Another
                existing problem is, when a relevant authority attempts to
                modify the data, we need to find the history of the old records
                and in addition the newly modified data should be added in such
                a way that the existing data is not altered. So, in such a
                situation if the data is changed there is no way to recover
                those details. So this is an existing, yet still an unanswered
                problem. If we do a modification, we allow to store the data in
                a separate block.

                Main objective of the Crime Prediction System is to develop a
                machine learning model to predict crimes in Sri Lanka. Using
                machine learning leads to get more accurate predictions. In this
                main objective, I used the latest data science and machine
                learning techniques to analyze data and make predictions
                accurately. When making a machine learning model, I tested many
                times to get the highest accuracy. This functionality will make
                an excellent support for the law enforcement authorities in
                creating a peaceful country.
